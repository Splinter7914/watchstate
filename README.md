This tool primary goal is to sync your backends play state without relying on third party services,
out of the box, this tool support `Jellyfin`, `Plex` and `Emby` media servers.

## updates

### 2024-05-05

**Edit** - We received requests that people are exposing watchstate externally, and there was concern that having open webhook
endpoints might lead to abuse. As such, we have added a new environment variable `WS_SECURE_API_ENDPOINTS`. Simply set
the environment variable to `1` to secure the webhook endpoint. This means you have to add `?apikey=yourapikey` to the end
of the webhook endpoint.

----- 

We are deprecating the use of the following environment variables `WS_DISABLE_HTTP`, `WS_DISABLE_CRON`, `WS_DISABLE_CACHE`,
and replacing them with `DISABLE_CACHE`, `DISABLE_CRON`, `DISABLE_HTTP`. The old environment variables will be removed in the future versions.
It doesn't make sense to mark them as `WS_` since they are global and do not relate to the tool itself. And they must be set from the `compose.yaml` file itself.

### 2024-05-04

The new webhook endpoint no longer requires a key, and it's now open to public you just need to specify the backend
name.

Refer to [NEWS](NEWS.md) for old updates.

# Features

* Sync backends play state (from many to many).
* Backup your backends play state into `portable` format.
* Receive Webhook events from media backends.
* Find `un-matched` or `mis-matched` items.
* Search your backend for `title` or `item id`.
* Display and filter your play state. Can be exported as `yaml` or `json`.
* Check if your media servers reporting same data via the parity command.
* Track your watch progress via webhooks.

----

# Install

create your `compose.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
services:
    watchstate:
        image: ghcr.io/arabcoders/watchstate:latest
        # To change the user/group id associated with the tool change the following line.
        user: "${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}"
        container_name: watchstate
        restart: unless-stopped
        # For information about supported environment variables visit FAQ page.
        # works for both global and container specific environment variables. 
        environment:
            - WS_TZ=UTC # Set timezone.
        ports:
            - "8080:8080" # webhook listener port.
        volumes:
            - ./data:/config:rw # mount current directory to container /config directory.
```

Create directory called `data` next to the `compose.yaml` file. After creating your docker compose file, start
the container.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ./data && docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's really important to match the `user:` to the owner of the `data` directory, the container is rootless, as such
> it will crash if it's unable to write to the data directory. It's really not recommended to run containers as root,
> but if you fail to run the container you can try setting the `user: "0:0"` if that works it means you have permissions
> issues. refer to [FAQ](FAQ.md) to troubleshoot the problem.

> [!NOTE]
> For `Unraid` users You can install the `Community Applications` plugin, and search for `watchstate` it comes
> preconfigured. Otherwise, to manually install it, you need to add value to the `Extra Parameters` section in advanced
> tab/view. add the following value `--user 99:100`. This has to happen before you start the container, otherwise it
> will
> have the old user id, and you then have to run the following command from
> terminal `chown -R 99:100 /mnt/user/appdata/watchstate`.

> [!NOTE]
> To use this container with `podman` set `compose.yaml` `user` to `0:0`. it will appear to be working as root
> inside the container, but it will be mapped to the user in which the command was run under.

# Adding backend

After starting the container you should start adding your backends and to do so run the following command:

> [!NOTE]
> to get your plex token, please
> visit [this plex page](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/) to
> know
> how to extract your plex token.
> For jellyfin & emby. Go to Dashboard > Advanced > API keys > then create new api keys.

```bash
$ docker exec -ti watchstate console config:add
```

This command is interactive and will ask you for some questions to add your backend.

# Managing backend

To edit backend settings run

```bash
$ docker exec -ti watchstate console config:manage -s backend_name
```

# Importing play state.

What does `Import` or what does the command `state:import` means in context of watchstate?

Import means, pulling data from the backends into the database while attempting to normalize the state.

To import your current play state from backends that have import enabled, run the following command:

```bash
$ docker exec -ti watchstate console state:import -v
```

This command will pull your play state from all your backends. To import from specific backends use
the `[-s, --select-backend]` flag. For example,

```bash
$ docker exec -ti watchstate console state:import -v -s home_plex -s home_jellyfin 
```

> [!NOTE]
> Now that you have imported your current play state enable the import task by adding the following environment
> variables to
> your `compose.yaml` file `WS_CRON_IMPORT=1`. By default, we have it disabled. for more environment variables
> please
> refer to [Environment variables list](FAQ.md#environment-variables).

### Supported import methods

Out of the box, we support the following import methods:

* Scheduled Task. `Cron jobs that pull data from backends on a schedule.`
* On demand. `Pull data from backends on demand. By running the state:import & state:export command manually`
* Webhooks. `Receive events from backends and update the database accordingly.`

> [!NOTE]
> Even if all your backends support webhooks, you should keep import task enabled. This help keep healthy relationship.
> and pick up any missed events.

# Exporting play state

What does `export` or what does the command `state:export` means in context of watchstate?

Export means, sending data back to backends, while trying to minimize the network traffic.

To export your current play state to backends that have export enabled, run the following command

```bash
$ docker exec -ti watchstate console state:export -v
```

This command will export your current play state to all of your export enabled backends. To export to
specific backends use the `[-s, --select-backend]`flag. For example,

```bash
$ docker exec -ti watchstate console state:export -v -s home_plex -s home_jellyfin 
```

> [!NOTE]
> Now that you have exported your current play state, enable the export task by adding the following environment
> variables to
> your `compose.yaml` file `WS_CRON_EXPORT=1`. By default, we have it disabled. for more environment variables
> please
> refer to [Environment variables list](FAQ.md#environment-variables).
